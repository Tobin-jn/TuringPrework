				<h2>Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park</h2>
				<img class="black-canyon-pic" src="images/blackcanyon.jpg" alt="Black Canyon National Park" title="Black Canyon of the Gunnison">
					<p>	The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is home to the Black Canyon, a magnificent canyon in Western Colorado. The canyon was carved out by the Gunnison River over 2 million years. Today is a popular destination and is managed by the National Park Service. The Black Canyon became a national park in 1999 and sees roughly 200,000 visitors a year. The canyon is famous for its very steep walls and is incredibly narrow in spots. Because of this, little sunlight makes its way to the bottom of the canyon, giving the canyon its name.</p>
					<p>The park is a great destination in Colorado. Popular activities include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Camping</li>
						<li>Hiking</li>
						<li>Rock Climbing</li>
					</ul>

			<img class="mesa-verde-pic" src="images/mesaverde.jpg" alt="Mesa Verde National Park" title="Cliff Dwellings at Mesa Verde">
				<p>Mesa Verde National Park is in the southwestern corner of Colorado and home to ancient archaeological sites. The National Park was established in 1906 and is the largest archaeological preserve in the US. It is home to more than 4,000 sites, including 600 cliff dwellings. These unique structures were built into the high cliffs in caves or naturally occurring recesses in the rock face. The area had been home to ancient civilizations for centuries, including the Anasazi Native Americans.</p> 

				<p>Today the park sees roughly 500,000 visitors per year. Several large cliff dwellings have great vantage points and a few allow visitors inside. Mesa Verde is a great glimpse into the history of North America and a top destination in Colorado.</p>

			<h2>Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve</h2>
			<img class="sand-dunes-pic" src="images/sanddunes.jpg" alt="Great Sand Dunes National Park" title="Sand Dunes at the National Park">
				<p>The Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is a unique landscape nestled in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Home to the tallest dunes in North America, the park offers visitors a diverse experience. The park is on the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley in south-central Colorado. The park sits alongside a preserve that protects the surrounding ecosystems.</p>

				<p>The Sand Dunes was established as a national park in 2004 and sees nearly 500,000 visitors per year. The park is of geological interest as the sediment collected here from the surrounding mountains and receded lakes over tens of thousands of year.
